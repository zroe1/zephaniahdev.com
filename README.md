zephaniahdev.com is a new personal website I created with React and three.js. It serves as a home to all my important profiles and projects. Additionally, it contains an interactive user interface, and customizable settings, made possible by the powerful features built into React.

The site can be found at <b><a href="https://zephaniahdev.com/">zephaniahdev.com</a></b>.

A video demo where I click through some of the site's main features can be found below:
