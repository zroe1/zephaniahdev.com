# zephaniahdev.com
zephaniahdev.com is a new personal website I created with React and three.js. It serves as a home to all my important profiles and projects. Additionally, it contains an interactive user interface, and customizable settings, made possible by the powerful features built into React.

## Current Status of Project

The site is fully functional at zephaniahdev.com! I am working on cleaning up the code and deleting things that aren't necessary. I am also working on making the mobile version of the site less crowded and more organized. Updates coming soon...
