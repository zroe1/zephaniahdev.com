zephaniahdev.com is a new personal website I created with React and three.js. It serves as a home to all my important profiles and projects. Additionally, it contains an interactive user interface, and customizable settings, made possible by the powerful features built into React.

<b>THIS SITE IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION</b>  
Beware of broken links and other strange occurences...
